Over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@bcionescu) I create video guides. Given that some people refer to read, instead of watching videos, I will include the written version of each guide, where applicable, here.

## Vim
- [Basics of Vim](vim/basics-of-vim.md)
- [Vim tips doctors don't want you to know](vim/vim-tips-doctors-don't-want-you-to-know.md)

## Backups

- [Borg Automation](backups/borg-automation.md)
- [Raspberry Pi with Syncthing](backups/raspberrypi-syncthing.md)
